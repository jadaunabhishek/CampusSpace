SRM INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY is widely recognized for its exceptional facilities, which we believe set a standard that every other educational institution aspires to achieve. With top-tier leaders, management, faculties, technology, and a multitude of other facilities, SRM is a leading institution in higher education.
As an institution committed to technological advancement, SRM has consistently provided cutting-edge facilities to serve its community. Building on this, we are excited to introduce 'SRM Campus-Spaceâ€™, an all-in-one booking facility application. This user-friendly application enables swift and easy booking of auditoriums, halls, 
laboratories, classrooms, and hotel rooms. With this app, faculties and management can efficiently manage their class bookings, lab reservations, and event bookings for auditoriums, as well as hotel room reservations for visiting chief guests, panel members, and resource persons.
